An Ansible playbook to deploy and configure an ELK stack on your hosts.

## Deployment diagramm

## Tests and simulations

### Basics

You have to run multiples tests. *tests with an # are mandatory*

```MARKDOWN
# lint
# syntax
# converge
# idempotence
# verify
side_effect
```

Executing theses test in this order is called a "scenario" and Molecule can handle them.

Molecule use Ansible and pre configured playbook to create containers, prepare them, converge (run the playbook) and verify its execution.
You can manage multiples scenario with multiples tests in order to get a 100% code coverage.

This playbook contains a ./tests folder. In this folder you can use the inventory or the tower folder to create a simualtion of a real inventory and a real AWX / Tower job execution.
